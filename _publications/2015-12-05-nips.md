## Abstract 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be shifted across 2D images or 3Dvideos to segment them. They have a fixed input size and typically perceive onlysmall local contexts of the pixels to be classified as foreground or background. Incontrast, Multi-Dimensional Recurrent NNs (MD-RNNs) can perceive the entirespatio-temporal context of each pixel in a few sweeps through all pixels, especiallywhen the RNN is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Despite these theoreticaladvantages, however, unlike CNNs, previous MD-LSTM variants were hard to par-allelise on GPUs. Here we re-arrange the traditional cuboid order of computationsin MD-LSTM in pyramidal fashion. The resulting PyraMiD-LSTM is easy to paral-lelise, especially for 3D data such as stacks of brain slice images. PyraMiD-LSTMachieved best known pixel-wise brain image segmentation results on MRBrainS13(and competitive results on EM-ISBI12)
